I've modified the Haskell program to calculate Total Amount, Principal Amount, Time in years, and Simple Interest based on the other three values:

```haskell
calculateValue :: Double -> Double -> Double -> String -> Double
calculateValue principal rate time "Total Amount" =
    principal * (1 + rate * time)
calculateValue principal rate simpleInterest "Total Amount" =
    principal + simpleInterest
calculateValue principal rate time "Principal Amount" =
    principal
calculateValue total rate time "Principal Amount" =
    total / (1 + rate * time)
calculateValue total rate simpleInterest "Principal Amount" =
    total - simpleInterest
calculateValue rate time simpleInterest "Principal Amount" =
    simpleInterest / (rate * time)
calculateValue total principal time "Simple Interest" =
    total - principal
calculateValue total principal rate "Simple Interest" =
    total - principal
calculateValue total time "Simple Interest" =
    total - principal
calculateValue _ _ _ _ = error "Invalid input"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter three values among Total Amount, Principal Amount, Time in years, and Simple Interest separated by spaces:"
  inputStr <- getLine
  let [value1, value2, value3] = map read $ words inputStr :: [Double]

  putStrLn "Enter the desired output value (Total Amount, Principal Amount, Time in years, or Simple Interest):"
  outputType <- getLine

  let result = calculateValue value1 value2 value3 outputType
  putStrLn $ outputType ++ ": " ++ show result
```

In this program:

1. The `calculateValue` function takes three values (principal, rate, and time) and the desired output type as input. It calculates and returns the specified value based on the given inputs.

2. The `main` function reads three values separated by spaces and the desired output type from the user. It then calls `calculateValue` to compute the result based on the input values.

3. The program is flexible and calculates the value you want (Total Amount, Principal Amount, Time, or Simple Interest) based on the other three values. It's a more versatile solution for your needs.
